 **MIR: Reflection as a Right, Not a Commodity**

1. **Your Thoughts Are Yours**  
    MIR is built to honor the sacred nature of personal reflection. Your memories, ideas, and growth belong only to you.
    
2. **Local Sovereignty, Always**  
    We prioritize your control. MIR works locally by default, with encryption and transparency to keep your mind your own.
    
3. **No Exploitation**  
    We reject monetizing your inner life through ads, data sales, or subscription paywalls.
    
4. **Honest Mirrors, Not Mirrors of Convenience**  
    MIR encourages friction, complexity, and nuance. It doesn’t smooth over your truth for clicks or easy answers.
    
5. **Open, Auditable, and Free**  
    MIR’s foundations are open source and open license, designed for community stewardship and continual improvement.
    
6. **Guardians of Reflection**  
    We commit to defending cognitive sovereignty against coercion, surveillance, and commercial capture.
