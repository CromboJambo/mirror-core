## **MirrorTag: Proof of Reflection**

A **MirrorTag** is a small, cryptographically signed metadata capsule that gets attached to every significant reflection, thought, or AI interaction. It acts like a **semantic timestamp**—but deeper. It’s not about just _when_ something happened—it’s about **what it meant**, and that it **happened in your system**.

## Core Goals

|Goal|Function|
|---|---|
|✅ **Proof-of-presence**|Show that a reflection occurred (local)|
|✅ **Chain-of-thought**|Log the evolution of an idea|
|✅ **Source protection**|Establish authorship and temporal order|
|✅ **Trust calibration**|Feed confidence-weighting over time|
|✅ **Sovereignty**|Keep everything local and self-verifiable|

## MirrorTag Spec (First Draft)

Each tag could contain:

`{   "id": "mtg-1699839390",
"timestamp": "2025-07-30T12:34:56Z",   
"content_hash": "sha256:8dfb...",   
"semantic_fingerprint": ["mirror", "trust", "meta-reflection"],   
"reflection_type": "compass", // or 'distraction', etc.   
"signature": "device-signed-pgp-or-ed25519-token",   
"mirror_version": "0.1.4-alpha",   
"context_score": 0.92 }`

## Signature Options

- Ed25519 or Curve25519 public/private key pair stored locally per device
    
- Each MirrorTag is **signed by your device**, creating an attestable chain
    
- (Later) you could **cross-sign** with other mirrors you trust, forming a reflection web
