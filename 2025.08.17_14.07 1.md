Can you please help me look into, like, what was going on? I don't think you can look at GitHub directly or whatever, but if you go to the net and, like, get a vibe for what was going on on GitHub, beginning of June 2025. So, like, early June, late May 2025.Were there any significant, really big releases or anybody notable, increasing downloads of anything around that time?

Thought for 52s

Here’s the straight read on what was popping on/around GitHub in late May → early June 2025:

- **Node.js 24 landed (May 6).** Fresh “Current” major—big deal for JS stacks and CI matrices; many repos bumped engines and pipelines right after. [endoflife.date](https://endoflife.date/nodejs?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **vLLM pushed rapid releases end-of-May.** 0.8.0 (May 27) and 0.9.0 (May 30) on PyPI—these correlated with a visible uptick in issues/PRs and downstream wrappers on GitHub (serving OpenAI-compatible APIs, long-context tuning, etc.). [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/vllm/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Bun churned through 1.2.x patches (June).** Active patch cadence with 1.2.18 verified June 11; ongoing fixes/perf + Node-compat improvements kept Bun repos trending in PR activity. [GitHub](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/releases?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **WWDC week (June 10) → Swift activity spike.** Swift 6.x updates (notably 6.2 topics) lit up iOS/macOS repos—migrations, concurrency tweaks, toolchain bumps. Expect spiky commit graphs across popular Swift projects that week. [Medium](https://medium.com/%40mihaipopa/wwdc-25-explained-ready-for-swift-6-2-3e240380441f?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/1l71sfn/wwdc_2025_megathread/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **GitHub itself had platform noise.** Actions delays on **May 28** and three June incidents—this kind of infra turbulence often shows up as retry storms and workflow-related PR chatter. [The GitHub Blog+1](https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/github-availability-report-may-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Llama-4 variants hit GitHub Models in April; momentum carried into June.** Lots of adapters, runners, and evaluation repos kept gaining stars and downloads through early June. [The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-04-14-the-llama-4-herd-is-now-generally-available-in-github-models/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) ecosystems were heating up.** Early June round-ups flagged a flurry of new servers/connectors—exact repos varied, but the pattern was clear in agent/tooling circles. [Pomerium](https://www.pomerium.com/blog/june-2025-mcp-content-round-up?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Cultural blip:** GitHub crossed **1 billion repos** mid-June (June 13). Not technically “important,” but it pulled attention to the platform and briefly skewed trending. [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/software/milestone-one-billionth-github-repo-is-just-the-word-sh-t?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Front-end toolchain backdrop:** Vite 6 (earlier in 2025) continued to ripple—defaults and Node support policies lined up with the Node 18 EOL window (end of April), so lots of projects were aligning by May/June. [vitejs+1](https://vite.dev/blog/announcing-vite6?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

### Bottom line

- If you felt unusual motion: **JS runtimes (Node 24, Bun patches), Swift WWDC changes, and fast-moving LLM serving stacks (vLLM)** were the main drivers of spikes—new releases, migration PRs, and dependency bumps all clustered in that late-May/early-June window.
    

If you want, I can pull **package-level time series** (npm/PyPI downloads, GitHub stars) for specific repos/runtimes you care about—e.g., `vllm`, `open-webui`, `llama.cpp`, `bun`, key Swift libs—and show who actually surged in that exact two-week window.

Here’s a no-nonsense breakdown of the **most relevant and high-impact developer tools** that were making major moves in late May–early June 2025. I’ve categorized them so you see exactly where to focus:

---

## AI-Powered Coding Agents (The Real Game-Changers)

- **The Third Generation of AI coding tools landed** around mid-May to early June. These tools—like GitHub Copilot agentic DevOps, OpenAI Codex agent, Zencoder Zen Agents, Anthropic’s Claude 4, Google’s Jules, and Zentester—started automating entire workflows: writing, reviewing, CI/CD integration, testing. This is not just auto-complete—it’s orchestrating development.[TechRadar](https://www.techradar.com/pro/the-three-generations-of-ai-coding-tools-and-what-to-expect-through-the-rest-of-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **OpenAI Codex entered research preview**. A self-sufficient agent that can write, debug, test, explain codebases—available for ChatGPT Pro, Team, and Enterprise users.[The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/openai-launches-new-ai-coding-agent-c8dabc60?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Corporates are moving fast**: by May 2025, adoption of agentic AI in development grew from ~50% to 82%. AI-assisted code reviews jumped from 39% to 76%. Fully autonomous code submission workflows are in early pilot stages (~8%). Top tools include GitHub Copilot Reviewer, Cursor BugBot, CodeRabbit, Graphite, Greptile.[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-coding-agents-adoption-top-tools-2025-8?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

**Takeaway**: If you’re not already testing or adopting agentic AI that can touch every part of your SDLC—issue tracking, PR generation, testing, deployment—you’re lagging. Start now.

### Final Word—Be Logical, Be Tactical

Agentic AI is clearly the tech to watch. Whether you’re writing code, managing tests, or deploying, smart AI agents are already doing the heavy lifting. Don’t wait until 2026 to catch up—start experimenting now.

Let me know if you want to deep dive on any tool—star download trends, integrations, how to pilot them fast.

##### You said:

I'm ready to build MIR. Everything needs to be open source, sovereignty-focused, and open model, like clarity, audit trail, like fully transparent, and no lock-in subs and in the dependencies, at least for the very minimum. So I wanna build it like basically with everything free because there's only gonna be a free tier. It's just, that's all there is to it.

###### ChatGPT said:

Thought for 28s

Good. Here’s a practical, lock-in-free plan for **MIR v0.1 (free tier only)** that stays fully open, local-first, and auditable.

# The MIR Free Stack (v0.1)

**Core principles**

- Local by default. No cloud calls.
    
- All dependencies OSI-approved (or truly open-weight for models).
    
- Plain files + SQLite. Everything exportable.
    
- Append-only audit trail with verifiable hashes.
    
- Swappable models/components (no single-vendor choke points).
    

## 1) Runtime + Packaging

- **Language:** Rust (daemons/CLIs) + TypeScript (UI).
    
- **Desktop shell:** **Tauri** (tiny, no Electron bloat).
    
- **CLI:** Rust `clap` + `tokio`.
    
- **Build reproducibility:** Nix flake (optional) or just Cargo + pnpm.
    

## 2) Storage & Index

- **Primary DB:** **SQLite** (bundled, zero admin).
    
- **Search:** SQLite **FTS5** for full-text.
    
- **Vectors:** `sqlite-vec` or `pgvector` (if you later outgrow SQLite, move to Postgres without semantic changes).
    
- **Blob store:** content-addressed files under `~/.mir/store/<sha256[:2]>/…` with a metadata row in SQLite.
    
- **Audit trail:** append-only table with `(event_id, parent_hash, event_json, event_hash)`; each event hash = `BLAKE3(parent_hash || event_json)` → verifiable Merkle-ish chain.
    

## 3) Crypto & Sync

- **Encryption:** `age` (file-level), `libsodium` (in-app).
    
- **Keys:** file keys sealed to a **YubiKey**/FIDO2 or local passphrase; rotateable.
    
- **Signing:** `minisign` for exports; optional `cosign` if you distribute binaries.
    
- **Peer sync (optional):** **Syncthing** for LAN/peer replication (no servers).
    

## 4) Models (fully local, swappable)

- **Inference engine (text):** **llama.cpp** (CPU/GPU, portable).
    
- **STT:** **whisper.cpp** (offline transcription).
    
- **Embeddings:** small open-weight models (e.g., **bge-small** / **E5-small**).
    
- **Default chat model:** pick an **open-weight 7–8B** model that runs on your hardwCan you please help me look into, like, what was going on? I don't think you can look at GitHub directly or whatever, but if you go to the net and, like, get a vibe for what was going on on GitHub, beginning of June 2025.

---

​￼# No-Lock-In Checklist (bake this into CI)

- ✅ **Build without network** (after first `models/` is populated).
    
- ✅ All outputs = **Markdown/JSON/CSV/SQLite**.
    
- ✅ **Model registry is a file**, not a SaaS endpoint.
    
- ✅ Every event is **hash-linked** and reproducible with pinned tool versions (record `--version` of `whisper.cpp`, `tesseract`, etc.).
    
- ✅ Single binary + SQLite file restore the system.
    

---

​￼# Suggested first models/tools (swap anytime)

- **Text:** a small, efficient 7–8B open-weight that runs on your GPU/CPU. Keep it pluggable—don’t hardcode.
    
- **Embeddings:** **bge-small** or **E5-small** (fast, decent).
    
- **STT:** **whisper.cpp base/small** depending on your CPU.
    
- **OCR:** **Tesseract**.
    

_(Before pinning, quickly re-check each model’s license. If any license isn’t OSI-style or you’re unsure, pick another—hence the registry.)_

---

​￼# Next steps (concrete)

​￼1. I’ll generate:
    
    - `SQLite` schema migrations
        
    - a Rust `mird` skeleton (Axum service + CLI commands)
        
    - a basic Tauri UI with search + recorder
        
    - `models.yaml` and a simple downloader that **only** pulls from URLs you list
        
​￼2. Then we wire your earlier concepts:
    
    - **MirrorTags** = YAML front-matter on each doc + a tags table.
        
    - **MirrorDock** = a tiny listener that triggers ingest when your phone is placed on the dock (uDev event → script).
        
    - **OpenMyMirror** = the Tauri UI packaged standalone.
        
    - **Audit export** = `mir export --since <event_id>` → a tarball with `items/`, `events.jsonl`, `verify.sh`.
        

Say the word and I’ll drop the initial repo skeleton (code + schema + Makefile) exactly to this spec so you can `cargo run` and get to first ingest/search fast.are; keep it configurable via a model registry (`models.yaml`).
    
    - Rule: model pulled from a local path; license validated at install.
        
- **OCR (images/PDF):** **Tesseract** (CLI) + `pdftotext` fallback.
    

## 5) RAG & Semantics

- **Ingestion pipeline:**
    
    1. Watch folders / voice memo dropbox →
        
    2. Normalize (text, audio→text via whisper.cpp, PDFs via Tesseract/`pdftotext`) →
        
    3. Chunk (rule-based first, semantic later) →
        
    4. FTS5 index + vector embed→SQLite.
        
- **Query:** hybrid (BM25 + vector) with Rust service that merges scores and returns passages + provenance (file path + byte offsets + hash).
    
- **Tagging:** system tags (timestamp, source, device) + optional mood estimate for voice memos; everything overrideable.
    

## 6) APIs & UI

- **Local API:** Unix socket/localhost HTTP on random high port; never exposed by default.
    
- **MIR CLI:** `mir ingest`, `mir query`, `mir export`, `mir verify`.
    
- **MIR UI (Tauri):**
    
    - unified search bar (hybrid RAG)
        
    - recorder (push-to-talk → whisper.cpp)
        
    - timeline with event hashes and diff
        
    - export to **plain Markdown** (+ YAML front-matter) into an **Obsidian** vault folder.
        

## 7) Telemetry = Zero

- No analytics. Optional local counters only. If enabled, they live in SQLite and are exportable. Nothing leaves the box.

# Minimal, shippable MVP (2–3 days of focused work)

1. **Scaffold**
    

`# backend cargo new mird --bin cd mird && cargo add tokio axum serde serde_json blake3 rusqlite r2d2 # ui pnpm create tauri-app`

2. **SQLite schema (v0)**
    

`-- items (unique content blobs) CREATE TABLE item (   id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,              -- sha256 (hex)   kind TEXT NOT NULL,               -- note|audio|pdf|img|meta   bytes INTEGER NOT NULL,   created_ts INTEGER NOT NULL,   enc_scheme TEXT DEFAULT NULL      -- e.g., age );  -- docs (text views of items) CREATE TABLE doc (   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,   item_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES item(id),   text TEXT NOT NULL ); CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE doc_fts USING fts5(text, content='doc', content_rowid='id');  -- vectors CREATE TABLE embedding (   doc_id INTEGER REFERENCES doc(id),   dim INTEGER NOT NULL,   vec BLOB NOT NULL ); CREATE INDEX embedding_doc ON embedding(doc_id);  -- audit CREATE TABLE event_log (   event_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,   parent_hash BLOB,   event_json TEXT NOT NULL,   event_hash BLOB NOT NULL );`

3. **Pipelines**
    

- `mird ingest /path`
    
    - compute hash → add to `item`
        
    - if audio → run `whisper.cpp` → `doc + doc_fts + embedding`
        
    - if text/PDF → extract → `doc + doc_fts + embedding`
        
    - record an `event_log` entry with a deterministic JSON (include the file hash, tool versions, timestamps).
        
- `mird query "text"`
    
    - run FTS5; run embedding search; score-merge; return passages + exact provenance.
        
- `mird verify`
    
    - recompute event hash chain; print first divergence (if any).
        

4. **UI (Tauri)**
    

- single search box; result list with: snippet, file path, offset, item hash, “open in Obsidian.”
    
- mic button (hold-to-record) → saves WAV → `whisper.cpp` → auto-ingest.
