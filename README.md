# Mirror System – README

## What is Mirror?
Mirror is a sovereignty-first system that syncs, organizes, and reflects your digital self using a privacy-first AI assistant. It runs locally or optionally connects to a shared trust-net.

Inspired by concepts of reflection, consent, and self-authorship, Mirror empowers users to:
- Own and encrypt their data
- Tag content with quantum-style memory tokens (MirrorTags)
- Sync devices securely using physical triggers (like a MirrorDock)
- Interact with modular AI while retaining full sovereignty

---

## Core Modules
- **MirrorTags**: Lightweight cryptographic tokens for semantic versioning and trust.
- **MirrorDock**: A smart dock that syncs and clears your phone while charging, using end-to-end encryption.
- **MirrorBase**: The local-first knowledge and context base.
- **MirrorCloud (opt-in)**: A federated extension for syncing across mirrors.
