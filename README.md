# Mirror Project

A sovereignty-first, privacy-conscious, open AI framework. Mirror is designed as a reflective, distributed system for managing your personal data, insights, and AI interactions with dignity, security, and creativity.

## Key Components
- **MirrorDock**: Physical docking station with secure auto-sync
- **MirrorTags**: Lightweight cryptographic tokens for data provenance
- **MirrorBase**: Local database core with syncable modules
- **MirrorLicense**: Radical user-first license structure
- **OpenMyMirror**: Optional opt-in public mirroring interface

## Goals
- Replace coercive cloud models with consent-based, cryptographically signed interaction logs
- Enable local-first workflows that can optionally reflect into community tools
- Empower developers, creatives, and citizens to reclaim digital agency
