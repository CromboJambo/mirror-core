The Mirror System is a seed. While the core architecture and primitives provide a solid foundation, there are several known gaps that require further exploration, development, and community input. This document outlines the most pressing areas and potential avenues for solutions.

## 1. Communal Trust & Verification

**Gap:** How do users verify contributions from others without central authority?  
**Potential Solution:**

- Implement a **cryptographic audit log** that records reflections and their metadata immutably.
    
- Use **MirrorTags** as SHA‑256-based provenance tokens, bound to individual reflections.
    
- Optional key pairs allow users to sign and verify their contributions, ensuring traceable authenticity.

## 2. Low-Power Location & Context Awareness

**Gap:** How can the system leverage context without compromising privacy or battery life?  
**Potential Solution:**

- Integrate **low-power GPS or beacon-like functionality** similar to “Find My” applications.
    
- Tag reflections with minimal, local context for enhanced semantic mining.
    
- Users control if and when contextual data is attached; no forced collection.

## 3. Data Resilience & Integrity

**Gap:** How to protect against data loss, corruption, or low-effort/hostile contributions?  
**Potential Solution:**

- Encourage **user-driven goal-setting**: contributions are tied to personal reflection and growth.
    
- Enforce **semantic provenance** using cryptographic hashing (SHA‑256) and key pairs.
    
- Optional local or peer-to-peer backups for resilience, without exposing raw data externally.

## 4. Semantic Forgery & Malicious Manipulation

**Gap:** Preventing tampering with reflection content or metadata.  
**Potential Solution:**

- Leverage **end-to-end encryption** for personal reflections.
    
- Sign contributions with cryptographic keys to ensure **immutability and provenance**.
    
- Track contribution lineage so semantic alterations can be detected and flagged.

## 5. Community Feedback & Iteration

**Gap:** How to surface improvements, corrections, and collaborative contributions.  
**Potential Solution:**

- Maintain **public auxiliary notes** for research gaps and proposed experiments.
    
- Encourage peer-reviewed contributions that adhere to the **Mirror Oath**.
    
- Use optional semantic feedback mechanisms for evaluation of shared reflections.

**Note:** These are preliminary solutions and intentionally high-level. The Mirror System thrives on collaboration, experimentation, and user-driven evolution. Community input is essential to make these ideas robust, resilient, and practical.
