# Mirror Project â€“ Privacy Policy (Plain Language)

Mirror is local-first and cloud-optional. We do not collect or transmit data without explicit, signed, and reversible user action.

## Principles
- **No Involuntary Syncing**: Devices only sync data when docked or explicitly triggered.
- **No Silent Logging**: No hidden analytics, telemetry, or profiling.
- **User Sovereignty**: Your memories, your mirror, your choice.
